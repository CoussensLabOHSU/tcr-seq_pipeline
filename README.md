# TCR-seq pipeline

This repository is a collaboration between the Computational Biology Department at OHSU and Lisa Coussens lab for the analysis of TCR-seq data. Our methods have been previously published and hosted by the CompBio group. Currently, our efforts are centered towards reviewing, improving and potentially expanding our analysis, therefore, we have found a need to host all the code and project management under Lisa Coussens lab as separate organization on github. There are also efforts towards automating our analysis in the future and have a similar project under Galaxy and the SMMART group at OHSU, which will be then, hosted under the CompBio group. 

Most of the work done on this pipeline have been achieved through the hard work of previous contributors at OHSU, especially Wes Horton, whom we are very grateful. For new directions and updates on the status of the project, follow our Projects/Zenhub tabs and, by all means, feel free to create issues and reach out to our group. 

Thank you!
